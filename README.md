AuditEval: A Benchmark for Auditing Tasks in LLMs
## Introduction

AuditEval is a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the auditing domain. The purpose of this project is to provide a multidimensional framework for evaluating LLMs across a variety of auditing tasks. The framework focuses on key competencies such as auditing professional knowledge, practical application abilities, and academic expression skills. It also addresses gaps in current LLM evaluation benchmarks by offering a structured task system and fine-grained performance assessment.

This evaluation framework is essential for deploying LLMs in intelligent auditing applications, ensuring that they can effectively handle domain-specific challenges and provide high-quality outputs for real-world auditing tasks.
