Attestation, a statutory function of national audit institutions, is defined as authorized issuance of attestative opinions by national auditors on national accounts, governments5 consolidated financial reports, departments' budget execution, and governments' financial activities and information. Audit institutions hold auditees accountable through performance audit and its evolving forms such as project evaluation, policy audit and economic accountability audit. It is a function emerged along the development of national audit that aims to improve national governance. The change of role from attestation to accountability was a trend sweeping audit institutions around the world in the 20th Century, especially after the 1960s. It reflects the strong desire of national audit institutions to participate in global governance.

This paper adopts text-analysis to examine the relationship between the tone of key audit matters and the stickiness of corporate expenses. The study finds that the more negative the tone of key audit matters, the more significant the reduction in corporate expenses stickiness. The impact mechanism is that the tone of key audit matters reduces the stickiness of corporate expenses by dampening managers' optimistic expectations and reducing agency costs. Furthermore,from the perspective of audit reports, the test reveals that events and negative words can promote the negative relationship between text tone and corporate cost stickiness; from the perspective of information attention, the test shows that the negative relationship between text intonation and corporate expenses stickiness is more significant in samples with less analyst and media attention.

In view of this, this paper takes the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2018 as sample to test the relationship between CEO's risk preference and corporate fraud, as well as the moderating effect of audit pricing. The empirical results show that the higher CEO's risk preference, the higher companies' tendency to fraud, and that the audit pricing strategy can significantly weaken corporate fraud tendency. By further dividing corporate fraud into information disclosure fraud, corporate operating fraud and personal transaction fraud, it is found that the degree of CEO's risk preference only positively affects the tendency towards business operating fraud, while external audit pricing strategy only significantly weakens CEO's tendency towards transaction fraud. The mechanism shows that the negative moderating effect of audit pricing is mainly due to the increase in audit effort, which reduces the possibility that the auditor's excessively high risk premium will cause the governance effect of audit pricing to fail.

Although the principle of quality review is that the professional experience of reviewers should be higher than that of reviewees, it is observable that the former's experience is often lower than the latter's in practice, possibly due to the resource constraint of audit firms sending the reviewers. Using the data on peer review of public company audits organized by the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants(CICPA) during the period of 2007-2017, we find that the deviation between the actual disciplinary decision and the expected disciplinary probability is greater when reviewers have less audit experience than reviewed project leader. Moreover, such deviation is significantly mitigated when reviewers have previously participated in peer review, hold the quality control position in their employment audit firms, or come from large audit firms.

It is found that green tax system reform can reduce audit fees, and it is more likely to reduce audit fees in non-state-owned enterprises than in stateowned enterprises. Analysis of the influence mechanism reveals that the green tax system reform can reduce the environmental risk of firms by promoting enterprises to optimize environmental internal control, increase environmental protection investment and improve environmental information disclosure, thus causes auditors to reduce audit fees. Complementary tests find that green tax system reform can reduce the risks of corporate environmental frauds and corporate environmental cost, further confirming the logic that green tax reform curbs the increase in audit fees caused by environmental risks. The findings reveal the effectiveness of green tax reform in the audit market, expand the study of institutional factors of audit fees, and provide a decision reference for the government to improve the green tax system and for enterprises to optimize environmental management.\n任务：以上是一个来自审计领域的英文摘要，请将以上的英文摘要翻译为中文，确保翻译的专业性和准确性，并且只提供中文翻译结果，不要包含任何额外的解释或信息。", "answer": "本文以2018年《环境保护税法》实施为契机，运用沪深A股上市公司2013-2020年的经验数据，使用双重差分法探讨绿色税制改革对审计费用的影响。研究发现，绿色税制改革能够降低审计费用，且与国有企业相比，绿色税制改革更能降低非国有企业审计费用。影响机制分析发现，绿色税制改革能够通过促进企业优化环境内部控制、提高环境保护投资、改善环境信息披露来降低企业环境风险，从而促使审计师降低审计费用。补充性检验发现，绿色税制改革能够降低企业环境违规风险和企业环境成本风险，进一步印证了绿色税制改革能够治理由环境风险引致的审计费用上升的内在逻辑。研究结论揭示了绿色税制改革在审计市场上的有效性，拓展了审计费用的制度因素研究，为政府完善绿色税制、企业优化环境管理提供了决策参考。"}, {"id": "Sfd-88", "query": "摘要文本（英文）：Based on the scenario that M&A activities share auditors with target companies, we study the effect of shared auditors on M&A premium under institutional constraints.

Taking 2015-2019 A-share listed companies as sample, this paper investigates the audit risk contagion based on annual report comment letter. We find that the low-quality audit risk caused by annual report inquiry letters has a short-term contagion effect on the stock market. Compared with non-risk audit linked enterprises, the earnings quality of risk audit linked enterprises in the current year is significantly lower, and the probability of annual report being inquired by the exchange's in the next one to two years is significantly increased, which means that the audit risk based on the annual report comment letter has horizontal and vertical contagion. The above relationship is more obvious in the case of high audit risk intensity. Audit by \"Big Four\" and high-quality internal control can alleviate contagion effect. The more questions contained in the annual report inquiry letter, the more detailed the enterprise's reply and the need for special opinions from the annual audit accountant, the stronger the low-quality audit contagion effect. Finally, the change of signature auditors in the next year can effectively curb the vertical contagion of audit risk.

Based on the data of 30 provincial and city audit institutions and China's local government debt from 2010 to 2018, this paper examines the impact of government auditing on the local government implicit debt. The results show that government auditing effectively defuses the incremental risk of implicit local debt in the borrowing process, and improves the spending performance of implicit local debt in the using process. Specifically, government audit has a salient influence on direct hidden debt risks and contingent hidden debt risks.

Further, the closer the relationship between the follower client and the auditor is, the stronger the auditor's preference for the follower client will be. However, the stricter the accounting firm's quality control mechanism is, the more effective it is to restrain the auditor's motivation to treat follower client favorably. In the further analysis, compared with the auditor's flow to the head office, in the case of flow to the branch office, the auditor's preferential treatment on the audit opinion of the follower client is more obvious. When auditors flow to developed areas and strict legal environment, the auditor's preferential motivation for follower clients is somewhat convergent.

This paper exploits the staggered implementation of KAM as a quasi-natural experiment to investigate whether KAM disclosure causes spillover effects on the internal control weaknesses(ICW). Research through the entropy balancing technique shows that after the implementation of KAM, companies are more likely to disclose ICW. After conducting a series of robustness tests,the results are robust. Furthermore, we find that the KAM disclosure reduces information asymmetry of market participants and increases audit input which leads to managers' truthful disclosure of ICW and timely remediation.Finally, we find that the positive spillover effects of KAM disclosure are more prominent for auditors working in non-Big 4 firms and with industry expertise, as well as in companies with stronger concealment motive on the part of management.\n任务：以上是一个来自审计领域的英文摘要，请将以上的英文摘要翻译为中文，确保翻译的专业性和准确性，并且只提供中文翻译结果，不要包含任何额外的解释或信息。", "answer": "揭示关键审计事项披露在管理层信息披露行为中的经济后果，对评估新审计报告具有重要意义。本文以新审计报告准则分步实施作为准自然实验，实证考察关键审计事项披露对上市公司内部控制缺陷披露的溢出效应。基于熵平衡匹配样本研究发现，关键审计事项披露要求实施后，公司更可能披露内部控制缺陷。作用机制检验发现，这一影响主要通过信息环境改善增强外部监督，以及审计师审计投入增加促使管理层如实披露并及时修复来实现。研究还发现，关键审计事项披露的这一正向溢出效应主要集中在非“四大”和具有行业专长的审计师以及管理层隐瞒动机较强的公司。"}, {"id": "Sfd-321", "query": "摘要文本（英文）：This paper carried out research on the audit regarding grassland resource assets of one＇ lia Autonomous Region.

This paper finds that enterprises with the characteristics of \"high deposits and loans\" are more likely to be issued nonstandard audit opinions by auditors, indicating that auditors can effectively play the role of audit oversight. The internal mechanism is that auditors recognize that the \"high deposits and loans\" enterprises have low information transparency and high level of real earnings management, thus improving the probability of issuing non-standard audit opinions. From the perspective of regulatory effect, improving the auditor's industry expertise and corporate governance level will help mitigate the audit risk of the \"high deposits and loans\" anomaly.

Further analysis shows that trade uncertainty has a stronger incentive effect on audit quality for firms audited by \"non-top 100 firms\", firms with high industry concentration and low technology level. This mechanism is mainly realized by reducing firms' agency cost and increasing the media attention. This paper explores the relationship between trade uncertainty and audit quality, and also provides empirical evidence for dealing with the trade uncertainty.\n任务：以上是一个来自审计领域的英文摘要，请将以上的英文摘要翻译为中文，确保翻译的专业性和准确性，并且只提供中文翻译结果，不要包含任何额外的解释或信息。", "answer": "贸易不确定性持续上升，对企业的发展经营提出新的挑战。本文以2015-2020年的A股上市公司为样本，运用多期双重差分（DID）模型，将2018-2020年被列入“实体清单”作为外生事件，检验了贸易不确定性对我国相关企业审计质量的影响及机制。研究表明，贸易不确定性能够“倒逼”相关企业提高审计质量。进一步分析发现，贸易不确定性对非“百强事务所”审计的企业、行业集中度高、科技水平低的企业表现了更强的审计质量激励作用，作用机制主要通过减少企业的代理成本和提升媒体关注度来实现。本文探究了贸易不确定性与审计质量的关系，为应对贸易不确定性提供了经验证据。"}, {"id": "Sfd-384", "query": "摘要文本（英文）：The Sarbanes-Oxley Act adopted in 2002 requires independent auditing of internal control over financial reporting （ICFR） of public companies in the US.

Using unique datasets of audit adjustments and auditor’s man-hours obtained from Chinese Institutes of Certified Public Accountants(CICPA), it was found that the previous audit adjustments have a significantly positive impact on audit fees in the current period, and that auditor’s man-hours has a mediating effect. Specifically,our results suggest that audit fees not only consist of a risk premium but also costs covering related increases in auditor’s man-hours, both of which are associated with previous audit adjustments.Furthermore, our results are more pronounced in cases with downward audit adjustments, which suggests that audit risks have a spillover effect.

One theoretical explanation is that the audit firm optimizes resource allocation for internal governance. We test this theory from the perspectives of audit cost control and audit risk control. From the audit cost perspective, we predict that the audit firm is more likely to realign the client with a closer office if the client was audited by an office with a longer distance in prior year.

Moreover, greater accounting conservatism in last period is associated with lower probability of the issuance of qualified opinions in the current period, which means the anchoring and adjustment heuristic is the most prevalent heuristic judgment strategy in auditing judgment under uncertainty.\n任务：以上是一个来自审计领域的英文摘要，请将以上的英文摘要翻译为中文，确保翻译的专业性和准确性，并且只提供中文翻译结果，不要包含任何额外的解释或信息。", "answer": "审计意见如何形成是会计学界关注的重要问题。本文运用我国上市公司的数据，研究了环境不确定条件下审计意见的决策过程是否受到锚定效应的影响。研究发现，在环境不确定性高的公司中，上期会计稳健性能显著降低审计费用；同时，环境不确定性高的公司中，上期会计稳健性与当期非标准审计意见出具的概率显著负相关，而当期会计稳健性与非标意见出具的概率不相关，这说明审计师的决策过程存在明显的锚定效应，导致环境不确定性高的情况下审计意见的出具更倾向于审计师对公司上期的印象。本文对于理解审计师决策中的锚定效应以及预防其判断偏误具有借鉴意义。"}, {"id": "Sfd-486", "query": "摘要文本（英文）：Are audit and value creation correlated？ Through figuring out the issue, it could help to play the role of audit better and also to improve the auditing system. Audit is generally known as only performs supervision, and audit supervision cannot create value directly. In fact, audit has transformed from compliance audit and financial au dit to performance audit. The performance audit has received the most attention from national audit, social audit and internal audit. Apparently, performance audit is directly related to value creation. With the evaluation and ad visory function of audit, the performance audit could create value for the audit object. Moreover, the traditional compliance audit and financial audit are also related to value creation. The existence of audit not only improves the efficiency of resources allocation, but also plays an important role in improving social and market trust as well as decreasing transactions costs.

Serving as a train of thought of the working mode of internal audit of commercial banks for the innovation and reform against the background of the digital era, scenario audit is based on scenario theory and risk scenario, combines the advantages of offsite audit and continuous audit, and constructs a more systematic and refined new audit working mode, which alleviates the difficulty of applying big data analysis technology in audit. Taking the anti-money laundering audit scenario of China Minsheng Bank(CMBC) as an example, this paper sets up a systematic scenario audit workflow from four aspects, that is, audit task division and audit scenario construction, abstraction of business scenario data elements, construction of scenario audit data center, and construction of scenario display platform.

The findings suggest that despite facing multiple regulations, the CSRC's comprehensive inspections markedly impact the audit quality of accounting firms. This paper underscores the positive implications of incorporating comprehensive inspection methods in the CSRC's random inspection system, offering insights to refine audit regulatory approaches and bolster regulatory efficiency.\n任务：以上是一个来自审计领域的英文摘要，请将以上的英文摘要翻译为中文，确保翻译的专业性和准确性，并且只提供中文翻译结果，不要包含任何额外的解释或信息。", "answer": "提升审计质量离不开有效的外部监管。证监会对会计师事务所实施的全面检查能否提高其审计质量一直是学界和业界共同关心的重要问题。本文采用双重差分法研究发现，相较于未接受证监会全面检查的会计师事务所，接受证监会全面检查的会计师事务所在经历全面检查后审计质量显著提升，且这一结果主要体现在会计师事务所（审计师）客户重要性低、事务所规模大和审计客户财务复杂度低的样本中。研究结果表明，即使在审计行业面临多重监管的背景下，证监会实施的全面检查仍然对会计师事务所的审计质量提升产生了实质性影响。本文证实了证监会随机抽查制度中设置全面检查方式的积极意义，对优化审计监管方式，提高监管效率具有一定的政策启示。"}, {"id": "Sfd-536", "query": "摘要文本（英文）：Improving efficiency is one of the core issues facing China＇s accounting firms＇ in development and serving the building of multilevel capital market in the new era.

The study finds that when the company has abnormal audit fees, analysts reduce positive tone in their report in the following year, indicating that analysts believe that abnormal audit fees will reduce audit quality and increase the company's future performance risk. Further, according to the positive and negative segmentation of abnormal audit fees, it is found that analysfs perception of abnormal audit fees is mainly reflected in the negative abnormal audit fees. Finally, based on the analyst's personal characteristics and a company's financial situation, the study finds that the correlation between analysts5 tone and abnormal audit fees is more significant in the samples of female analysts and the company's low transparency.

The results show that direct investments in tax havens is positively correlated with audit fees. The reason is that listed companies with direct investments in tax havens have lower information transparency and higher agency costs, and thus they are more likely to pay higher audit fees. However, the increase in audit costs is not attributed to litigation risk, which is not increased due to direct investments in tax havens. Further researches show that Tax Information Exchange Agreement helps to mitigate the information risk caused by direct investments in tax havens, while good internal control helps to mitigate the information risk and agency risk caused by direct investments in tax havens.

This paper finds out that the listed company that hires the Big Four audit firms has a higher issuer rating, and that when controlling the information value of audit in the issuer rating, the debt rating is also higher. The impact of the Big Four on the issuer rating and debt rating is more significant in private enterprises and issuers without guarantee, indicating that the information value and the insurance value of audit plays a greater role when the credit risk is high. Compared with the NonBig Four, high earnings quality companies hiring the Big Four obtains higher issuer rating, which proves the information value of audit.

Through the method of text analysis, this study constructs an index of core competence of enterprises and empirically examines the influence of the core competence on auditors' decisions. The empirical results show that the stronger the core competence of enterprises is, the lower the probability of obtaining modified audit opinions and the audit fees will be. Compared with the core competence in capacity, core competence in resources has a more significant impact on auditors' decisions. In further analysis, we find that core competence can significantly reduce the risk of material misstatement and risks in operating the enterprise.
